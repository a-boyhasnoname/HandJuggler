**How to Play**
Open the game - Load index.html in a browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge recommended)
Grant camera permission - Allow access when prompted
Click "Start Game" - Wait for the ML model to load (~2-3 seconds)
Move your hands - Position your hands in front of the camera
Bounce the ball - Keep the ball in the air by hitting it with your hands

A ball falls due to gravity
Your hands create invisible "paddles" that bounce the ball upward
